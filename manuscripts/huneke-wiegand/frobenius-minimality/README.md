# Frobenius-minimality preprint

`main.tex` and `main.pdf` are version 0.03 of the CAOS Research preprint. It proves that the public
Huneke-Wiegand numerical-semigroup counterexample has the least possible Frobenius number, 181,
and is the unique normalized pair attaining that minimum within the nonprincipal two-generated
monomial-ideal class. It also proves an explicit infinite family in the same class for every
integer parameter `p>=4`.

Attribution is binding: Son Pham discovered the first public counterexample; CAOS contributes the
certified minimality, minimum-layer uniqueness, and parametric-family extensions. Professor Craig
Huneke's verification is external evidence, not authorship of this paper.

Evidence sources are EXP-001 through EXP-010 under
`problems/commutative-algebra/huneke-wiegand/`. The heavy proof archive is hash-addressed by the
committed EXP-004, EXP-005, EXP-006 and EXP-007 manifests. EXP-009 contains the family proof,
finite exact campaign, formula-independent auditor, and adversarial controls.

Version 0.02 remains frozen with this public-file verification:

- the concept latest, public metadata, sole author/ORCID and downloaded PDF all match the committed record

Version 0.03 is reserved and remains a draft until the two-pass build, warning scan, complete
rendered-page inspection, claim audit, upload, publication, and public-file hash verification pass.
